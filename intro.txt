You have entered the land of wonders full of ancient secerets that are buried deep in the desert you go to meet a very old monk who has lived by the great river and the massive pyramids his whole life and it is rumoured that he will have to test you if you pass his test he would give you a map to the hidden treasure of the first family which holds the most sacred secret of all the pharoic families. You enter the shack of the monk which is filled by drawings on the walls and very old scripts you hear a voice calling you from the dark . It says come here my young son in a deep old voice. You feel complied to follow his orders and when you approach the dark the old man whispers into his fingers you fall to the ground when you saw his fingers burst in flames which lights his whole shack the old man appears to have no eyes and no teeth with very white hair. He whispers"don't fear my son"and begins to ask you the questions
